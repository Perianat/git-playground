# Git Play Ground

This is a repository for you to familiarize yourself with git. Some intructions/commands below introduce you to the very basics of git. But of course there's much more...

## First Things: Git User Configuration

#### Have you already configured git with your user information on this machine?
Note that the configuration needs to be done only once on a machine

* If you do not remember, check using the following command:

```
git config --list

```

* If you do not see your user.name and user.email configure using:

```
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your@email.com"

```

Here *Your Name* and *your@email.com* will be attached to your commits and tags.


## Clone this repo

You can clone this repository and create your own branch and add text files/ codes etc.

```
git clone https://gitlab.rlp.net/psi2023/gitplayground.git

```
Carefully enter the correct *email-id* and *password* associated with your rlp gitlab account.
