# REPO_upd

## HOLA Rushabh, Neeraj!

#### I guess you are here to clone me ;)

#### But have you already added the ssh keys to make ssh cloning possible?
Follow the instructions on the link below: 
https://help.github.com/en/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh

If you have a github account and the admin of the repository(which is **tamasigithub** for this repository)
then you can have a look at the contents here:
https://github.com/tamasigithub/REPO_upd

On the right side you will see a green button 'clone or download'

Click on that and copy the link

Next go to the directory where you would like to clone this repository and type
git clone git@github.com:tamasigithub/REPO_upd.git
You can either use the ssh link to clone or https. ssh is recomended
